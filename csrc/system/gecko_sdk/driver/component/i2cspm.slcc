description: >
  This is an I2C Simple Polled Master driver that supports master mode with
  a single bus-master only. It blocks while waiting for the transfer to 
  complete, polling for completion in EM0. 


  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be 
  created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an 
  initialization struct set according to this configuration. These instance
  defines and variables are available in a generated header file, 
  sl_i2cspm_instances.h.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the I2CSPM Core component, which is 
  the implementation of the I2CSPM driver itself.
