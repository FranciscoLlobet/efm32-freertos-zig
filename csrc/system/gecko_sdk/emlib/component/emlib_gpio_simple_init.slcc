description: >
  Provides a simple initialization routine for GPIO.

  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an initialization routine according to this configuration. The initialization
  routine is available in a generated header file, sl_emlib_gpio_simple_init.h. 

  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in the project, the configured GPIO's will be initialized automatically during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.

  Selecting this component will also include the GPIO Init Core component, which is the implementation of the GPIO init routine.
