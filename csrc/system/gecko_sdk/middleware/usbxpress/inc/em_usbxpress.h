 * @brief
 *   USBXpress interface library
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 *   This module provides a firmware interface which communicates with the
 *   Silicon Labs USBXpress driver and allows firmware to interact with host
 *   programs via the USBXpress DLL.
 *
 * ## Theory of operation:
 *
 *   The USBxpress library interfaces with the Silicon Labs USBXpress drivers.
 *   The interface consists of two data transmission pipes (RX and TX) which
 *   are used to send and receive data.
 *
 *  ### Data
 *
 *   Data reception and transmission is handled with USBX_blockRead() and
 *   USBX_blockWrite(). Upon completion of a sent or received transfer the user
 *   is called back with USBX_RX_COMPLETE or USBX_TX_COMPLETE. If the user
 *   calls USBX_blockRead() with a numBytes value smaller than the number of
 *   bytes received in the transfer, the user is called back with both
 *   USBX_RX_COMPLETE and USBX_RX_OVERRUN set.
 *
 *  # Additional Resources

 *   * [Driver Customization - AN220](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/AN200.pdf)
 *
 *   This driver sits on top of the EFM32 USB Library.
 *
 * ## Interrupts
 *
 *   This library handles USB interrupts and will enable USB interrupts at
 *   its  discretion. It will NOT enable global interrupts and the user is
 *   responsible for enabling global interrupts.

 * If timing becomes an issue, consider using the call-back routine to set
 * user-defined flags that may be serviced in the project's main loop.
 * Additionally note that the call-back routine will be called for every
 * call-back source, whether or not the user checks for that call-back source.
